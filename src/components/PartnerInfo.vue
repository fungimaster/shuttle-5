          <h3 class="sub">Making it work for you and your company! Lay the foundation for success</h3>
          <p>Define success â€“ Your first step of preparing your participation at a conferences is to define what would be a success for this specific event. What do you want to get out of it? Is your main focus, sales, marketing or something else?Examples of specific goals include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you want to generate 100 sales leads?</li>
            <li>Or launch your new product to potential customers &amp; media?</li>
            <li>How about meeting at least 25 qualified new prospects?</li>
            <li>Do you want to handle 800 samples?</li>
            <li>Or would you like to distribute 1000 brochures?</li>
            <li>Maybe make 20 appointments?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The more concrete the goals are, the better your chances of achieving and measuring them. Establishing specific, measurable goals is quite likely the single most important thing you can do before &Oslash;redev.</p>
          <p>We would like to remind you that it is forbidden to hire new employees at &Oslash;redev. Hiring activities are forbidden on the exhibition floor, mentioning any kind of recruitment activities connected with &Oslash;redev on your social media channels are prohibited, too, during the time of the conference.</p>
          <p><img alt="Fun" src="/static/partners/info-fun.jpg" /></p>

          <h2 id="before-the-show">Before the show</h2>
          <h3 class="sub">Plan the booth to meet your goals</h3>
          <p>Your booth location, design, and activities should reflect what you hope to achieve. Even if you have a company exhibition booth in storage, think how you can tailor it to your needs. &Oslash;redev&rsquo;s conference team will help you to place your booth on the exhibition floor. <strong>Please note:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>There are no back walls of the booths. </li>
            <li>If you are planning to have activities during Thursday evening, please include lighting in your booth. We dim the lights at night to create a cosier atmosphere.</li>
            <li>You can build back walls but no long side walls â€” these would hide your neighbours and give a boxy feeling. Every wall we build is a psychological obstacle for the visitor to progress on the exhibition floor.</li>
            <li>We do not provide a TV or barcode scanner.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="malmo-mass-service">Malm&ouml; M&auml;ss-Service</h2>
          <p>Malm&ouml; M&auml;ss-Service can offer you whatever technological or cosmetic extras you might require to meet your particular needs. They have been on the market for more than twenty years and have a good experience in creating valuable meetings between exhibitors and visitors, they are here to assist you in ordering your booth. Of course, we advise you to build a beautiful, original booth, with things to experience or play with.</p>

          <p>Download their catalog at: <a target="_blank" href="www.mass-service.se">www.mass-service.se</a> or contact them at: +46 (0)40-30 67 20. Project Leader for &Oslash;redev, JÃ¶rgen JÃ¶nsson <a href="mailto:jorgen@mass-service.se">jorgen@mass-service.se</a>.</p>

          <h2 id="staffing">Staffing your booth</h2>
          <p>The number of staff manning the booth and the mix of disciplines should also be goal-driven. Do you need technical staff to explain things in detail? Top managers to meet blue-chip decision makers? Energetic extroverts for maximum smiling and sampling?</p>

          <p>From experience, we know &Oslash;redev delegates like to be challenged, and they are looking for technical experts and practitioners, not just sales representatives! We do not recommend &ldquo;booth babes&rdquo; at all.</p>
          <img alt="Manning your booth" src="/static/partners/info-manning.jpg" />

          <h2 id="during-oredev">During &Oslash;redev</h2>
          <p>As the conference team behind &Oslash;redev, we would like to give you some advice on how to make most of the human interactions on the exhibition floor. Never let an opportunity to mingle, network, meet new people, find new business, or just make a new friend pass you by!</p>
          <p>Five simple things to remember during &Oslash;redev: &nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Act like you&rsquo;re in a small town, say hello to everyone. </li>
          <li>Talk to the people in your neighbouring booths.</li>
          <li>Fully be in the now, &amp; engage in the discussion you&rsquo;re currently having.</li>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t worry as much about handing out your card as you do about getting their card.</li>
          <li>Laugh a lot, always remember to have fun!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Collecting Leads</h4>
          <p><a href="https://trippus.com/leads-management_/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an introductory video from Trippus, our badge provider.</p>
          <p>
            Collecting leads is included in the Top of the rock partnership. If you are a Splash partner, you have the opportunity to buy the scanning option. You will collect the following info: name, surname, email address and country of origin of the participant.
          </p>
          <p>For the privacy policy on scanning badges, see our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy policy</a>.</p>

          <h2 id="get-away-from-the-crowd">Get away from the crowd</h2>
          <p>Try to look for chances to be part of a smaller group and a meaningful conversation. Schedule a dinner with just a few friends and/or new contacts. You&rsquo;ll be surprised by the magic that happens in smaller groups.</p>
          <p><img alt="Cool" src="/static/partners/info-crowd.jpg" /></p>

          <h2 id="go-further">Go even further?!</h2>
          <p>Pretend you are the host of a big party, and the attendees are people who have chosen to come to your party. When you are sitting in the almost empty room before a session, take the initiative to break the ice. After all, &Oslash;redev is your party â€” that's how we would like you to feel!</p>

          <p>And last, but absolutely not least, remember &Oslash;redev&rsquo;s one great motto: We&rsquo;re all here to share knowledge and to have fun learning from each other, creating new friendships and initiating new businesses.</p>

          <h2 id="after-oredev">After &Oslash;redev</h2>
          <h3 class="sub">What to do after the show &amp; measuring its success</h3>
          <p>The visitors have all gone home. The stands are being taken down. Now is the time to follow through all of the new opportunities you&rsquo;ve generated. Here&rsquo;s where some companies squander the benefits they&rsquo;ve worked so hard to achieve while others capitalise on them and turn them into profits. How about trying, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>five new business ideas</li>
            <li>five intriguing lessons learned</li>
            <li>five blog posts</li>
            <li>five names of people you want to contact</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To gain the most out of &Oslash;redev, we recommend you to take the five most promising people you met, and follow up with them. Send them a brief email starting by reminding them of the details of who you are, where you met, and what you discussed. End the email with a few simple steps to make it extra easy for them stay in touch.</p>

          <h2>Measure your results</h2>
          <p>Remember your specific, measurable goals? Now is the time to measure your success against them.</p>

          <p>Track the leads, follow up all your new contacts. Did you generate 100 sales leads? Did you meet 25 qualified new prospects? Hopefully you enjoyed the conference this year as much as we do every year!</p>

          <h2 id="reserve-next-year">Reserve a place for next year!</h2>
          <p>If you&rsquo;ve met or exceeded your goals, this is the time to lock in a prime location at the next &Oslash;redev. And enjoy our early bird prices ;) Contact: <a href="mailto:info@oredev.org">info@oredev.org</a> for future partnership inquiries.</p>
          <p>We look forward to seeing you all there!<br />The &Oslash;redev Conference Team</p>
