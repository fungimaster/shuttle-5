          <h3>Electronic badges and lead scanning</h3>
          <p>We use badge scanning technology at our events for security reasons and to help improve your experience and network effectively with our delegates and exhibitors. Everyone attending Øredev requires an official, printed badge. The information displayed will be provided by you during registration – either online or on site.</p>

          <p>You’ll need to allow us to scan your badge to gain entry on to the exhibition floor and other restricted areas. All other badge scanning is optional. You do not have to let anyone else scan your badge. If you allow an exhibitor to scan your badge, you’re giving them a copy of some of your registration information: name, surname, email address and country just as if you were handing them a business card.</p>

          <p>The exhibitor may use this information to contact you after the event or for other purposes that you agree with them. The exhibitor’s use of your information in this situation is subject to your direct relationship with the exhibitor and their own privacy policies.</p>

          <p>We use Trippus as a supplier for badges and lead scanning services. They’ll process your information for us, and for the exhibitors that you authorise to access your information when they scan your badge. You can read about Trippus  compliance to GDPR in Swedish here (<a href="https://trippus.com/sv/trippus-gdpr-ready" target="_blank">https://trippus.com/sv/trippus-gdpr-ready</a>).</p>

          <h3>Photography &amp; Video</h3>
          <p>Attending Øredev, you consent to us using photographs and/or video recordings including images of you both internally and externally to promote the conference. These images could be used in print and digital media formats including print publications, websites, e-marketing, posters banners, advertising, film, and social media.</p>
          <p>You understand that images on websites can be viewed throughout the world and not just in Sweden and that some overseas countries may not provide the same level of protection to the rights of individuals as EU legislation provides. Some images or recordings may be kept permanently once they are published and be kept as an archive of Øredev's history.</p>

          <h3>How long will Öredev AB keep my information?</h3>
          <p>Your personal details from your registration will be retained for a period of three years.</p>
          <p>Your  personal details for marketing communications are retained&nbsp;as long as  you tell us that you no longer wish to receive marketing messages. We  will keep this information about you until you tell us otherwise.</p>

          <h3>What rights do I have over my personal data?</h3>
          <p>Under the GDPR, you have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access your personal data by making a subject access request.</li>
            <li>Rectification, erasure or restriction of your information where this is justified.</li>
            <li>Object to the processing of your information where this is justified.</li>
